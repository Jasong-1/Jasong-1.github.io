				<p class="news-content-text">In my role as the <a

						target="blank" class="bio-link" style="text-decoration:underline;"
						title="K12 Thought Leaders Announces Co-Chairs for Personalized Learning Chapter"><b>Co-Chair of
							K12 Thought Leaders Personalized Learning</b></a>, I am privileged to speak with educators
					from across the country. From what I am hearing, education may squander a great opportunity that the
					pandemic revealed. The pandemic showed the importance of engagement and wellbeing to an innovative
					organization.</p>
				<p class="news-content-text">For clarity, the K-12 Thought Leaders’ group is leading a dialogue
					regarding a comprehensive personalized digital ecosystem. Such an ecosystem will open opportunities
					for all learners both young and old to develop agency and self efficacy through a variety of
					subsystems currently supporting a “<i>paper and pencil </i>” system. Please view the trailer from
					our last conversation. <a href="https://youtu.be/RPgpoF8EqOI" target="blank" class="bio-link"
						style="text-decoration:underline;"
						title="Trailer for Cafe` 2 on PL Digital Ecosystem"><b>Trailer for Cafe` 2 on PL Digital
							Ecosystem</b></a></p>
				<p class="news-content-text" style="font-size:24px;"><b>#1 LEADERSHIP IS KEY</b></p>
				<p class="news-content-text">My take is that current educational leadership is not taking full advantage
					of the opportunity to collaborate across the ecosystem of education. We need leaders who see clearly
					the reality schools are facing and who are courageous in leading for the common good of all. Leaders
					open to adapting to a new world of teaching and learning as they create learning opportunities that
					are customized and personalized promoting student efficacy.</p>
				<p class="news-content-text">Today, the best leaders are those who embrace vulnerability and accept the
					humility to be an <a href="https://brightfutureconsulting.org/what-we-do/" target="blank"
						class="bio-link" style="text-decoration:underline;" title="Authentic leader"><b>authentic
							leader</b></a>. A leader needs to be who they are as a person and able to step into their
					leadership space using a style derived from their unique talents. The Gallup StrengthsFinder is one
					such tool to not only understand yourself as a leader but also enables teams of people to learn and
					lead together supporting the work of the organization.</p>
				<p class="news-content-text">We often hear the board of education, during the hiring process, state
					“<i>the next superintendent will be a collaborative leader</i>.” Or the new superintendent states
					during the interview process, “<i>I am a collaborative leader</i>.” Unfortunately, and all to often,
					their behavior does not match the statement.</p>
				<p class="news-content-text">A great example shared with me earlier this year is seen below. The
					superintendent called himself a collaborative leader but…</p>
				<p class="news-content-text">“<i>A small group of principals were huddled in the parking lot following
						the administrative team meeting. The conversation centered on why the superintendent had not
						consulted them prior to making the decision to require all staff to write specific grade level
						curriculum maps by the end of school in six short weeks</i>.</p>
				<p class="news-content-text"><i>The superintendent had sent an email to all staff without feedback or
						input from the leadership team. The principals discussed the short time line in the midst of
						reopening following the pandemic. They complained that they were unable to answer staff
						questions because they have no current information regarding the expectations of the initiative.
						The team felt out of the loop, and frankly disrespected</i>.”</p>
				<p class="news-content-text">Most of us have experienced this type of situation during our careers. It
					does not engage us in the work of the school or encourage us to be innovative when solving problems
					facing a school district. Clearly, people want to control the situation, they want their own way. It
					seems natural to want your way and control all decisions. However is that really possible?</p>
				<p class="news-content-text" style="font-size:24px;"><b>#2 INFLUENCE, ENGAGEMENT AND INNOVATION</b></p>
				<p class="news-content-text">In some cases a command and control approach is warranted such as a crisis
					being faced by an organization. Leaders do not always have the time to consult employees when
					dealing with a crisis.</p>
				<p class="news-content-text">However, outside of this crisis mode, we need leaders who influence their
					employees not command them. Leaders who involve them in the decision making process. Finally,
					leaders that encourage innovation between and among organizational members. It is especially true
					when dealing with large systemic issues that many school districts are facing.</p>
				<p class="news-content-text">When a leader uses a command and control style collective leadership is
					lost and with it influence, engagement and innovation decreases. Staff members become disengaged or
					worse become saboteurs because they do not feel valued or listened to by the leaders of the school.
					Yes, a leader may say they are collaborative but if they do not put that belief into action then
					people lose trust in the organization and its leaders. People observe people working out of fear or
					self-interest and maybe both. They soon realize the organization is not healthy or interested in
					what they might think will help the school flourish.</p>
				<p class="news-content-text">Engagement and building capacity of staff members are keys to the long term
					success of any organization. But to design such environments, leaders first must view organizations
					as interdependent systems. Systems that depend upon clarity of direction, shared autonomy with
					organizational trust coupled with a commitment to the truth. </p>
				<p class="news-content-text">To become a true learning organization, a clear process that engages staff
					as they uniquely design learning opportunities for all learners is needed. It is also critical to
					have a leader who first desires to build a learning organization and who understand the importance
					of shared leadership. This leader becomes a catalyst for positive change by leading the organization
					to learn together to meet the goals of the school. Such a leader empowers and engages organizational
					members by providing clarity, coaching staff and developing them to do their best work toward a
					shared purpose.</p>
				<p class="news-content-text" style="font-size:24px;"><b>#3 CREATIVE TENSION</b></p>
				<p class="news-content-text">It takes a system approach to become a learning organization. A system
					leader is a person who is very clear about the needs of the organization and how they merge with
					those of the individual staff member. This space is called creative tension. Creative tension is the
					space between our current reality and the future we desire for the school and its students. The
					group realizes that they may shape the future together, self-efficacy soon emerges from the team.
				</p>
				<p class="news-content-text">Creative tension depends on clear, transparent communication through
					two-way feedback loops that keep the entire school informed. More importantly these feedback loops
					create opportunities for leadership to listen, understand, and learn from what is happening in the
					organization from those closest to the work. Open direct conversation provides less “powerful”
					school members a greater voice with leadership. The free flow of information is critical for a group
					of people to learn together, helping the organization to be adaptive while maintaining its identity
					within a changing educational landscape.</p>
				<p class="news-content-text">Unfortunately, most schools are unwilling to let go of their fears and
					embrace the vulnerability of change that comes when seeking to be a learning organization. When an
					organization admits it might not have all the answers, people become fearful. Many leaders try and
					hide the fact that they do not have all the answers to the many complex questions of educating all
					students to a high level. These same leaders are afraid of two-way communication, afraid of
					criticism of their hard work, and afraid the public might uncover they do not have all the answers.
				</p>
				<p class="news-content-text">Consequently, the organization goes silent and innovative people go
					underground no longer sharing their expertise or what they are learning with colleagues. What some
					leaders fail to see is that the public does not expect you to have all the answers. But,
					stakeholders do want clarity, authenticity, and openness from the leader of a school and school
					district.</p>
				<p class="news-content-text">Great leaders set the conditions for team learning to take place leading to
					collective action. Learning organizations are ethical, equitable, and transparent. They are where
					all people feel cared for and valued by the organization. In most cases the community, if conditions
					are right, will support the school in maximizing the learning and the engagement of all students. A
					collaborative leader is able to hold open the space for creative tension to become a powerful and
					positive force within the organization.</p>
				<p class="news-content-text" style="font-size:24px;"><b>WHERE WE GO FROM HERE</b></p>
				<p class="news-content-text">We already know how to teach kids to be successful. We know how to create
					learning organizations. We just do not do it as we are fearful because we cannot control all aspects
					of the system. We allow our fears to stop us from truly letting go and allowing the system to learn
					and to adapt from an emerging future.</p>
				<p class="news-content-text">The pandemic revealed some of what the future might hold for the next
					generation of learners and teachers. We learned that compassion and empathy are important for both
					teachers and learners. We learned that some of our lessons didn’t matter. We learned what curricula
					was important. We found that relationships are more critical to learning than ever. We saw parents
					struggle and need help, our help. Remote and hybrid learning was actually good for some of our
					children. We observed that teachers could operate with autonomy!! Unfortunately, I am not sure our
					profession is truly ready to let go of the status quo and embrace a future of learning that will be
					personalized, customized, and digital. A personalized learning digital ecosystem is emerging from
					what was just experienced. As a profession, we need to prepare and to adapt to this new way of
					learning. It’s clear to me that to learn as a school our leaders need to engage the stakeholders by
					setting the conditions for success beginning with a collaborative culture where people share
					leadership.</p>
				<p class="news-content-text">Please stay tuned as I will continue to blog on how to set the conditions
					to build collaborative structures in your school leading to staff engagement and innovation.</p>
